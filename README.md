# Mobile Main Street
## What is it?
Mobile Main Street is a web-based publishing tool built for sharing real-time information from multiple members within a community. Unlike other platforms, we publish directly from community member's Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, or XML feeds. This means there's no need for storytellers and community members to login to post updates â€“ it's all done automatically.

## How does it work?
Once you set up your Mobile Main Street instance you add in the community members and their Twitter or Facebook usernames. Mobile Main Street pulls profile information from the community members' social profiles and then adds them to the category you specify. 

Mobile Main Street then checks your community members' social feeds every few minutes for updates and automatically publishes these updates to the appropriate category on your page. 

As the community leader you have the ability to add and remove people from your community, mute individual posts, and open and close registration. Most importantly, however, the community leader can also invite community members to create a Mobile Main Street account so they can mute any of their own posts and update their own profile information. 

## Install Guide
