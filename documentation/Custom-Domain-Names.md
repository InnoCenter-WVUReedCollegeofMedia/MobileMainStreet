Once you've got your Mobile Main Street community online, you'll probably want a custom web address that reflects your community's personality and purpose.

## Finding your Domain
Almost all registrars provide a way to search for domain name availability, but you may want more ideas about available domain names that could work for your community. 

[Domainr](https://domainr.com/) is a great tool for quickly searching for domain name availability, and [LeanDomainSearch](http://www.leandomainsearch.com/) can help you come up with ideas for available names.

## Registering your Domain
There's many great domain registrars out there, but we recommend the following for most people:

* [Google Domains (beta)](https://domains.google.com/)
* [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)
* [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)

For the more technically inclined we recommend [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/). 

## Setting up Your Domain
At this point, you'll want to look at your hosting provider's documentation for setting up a domain name. We've provided links to our recommended providers below.
